# Titanic Survival Prediction

## Description

This project aims to build a predictive model that can determine whether a passenger on the Titanic survived or not, using features like age, sex, class, and family size. The model is trained on the Kaggle Titanic dataset and submitted to the Kaggle competition.

## Data Source

* [Kaggle Titanic: Machine Learning from Disaster](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/titanic)

## Libraries Used

* pandas
* numpy
* scikit-learn

* seaborn

## Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

The `Data Analysis.ipynb` notebook contains the exploratory data analysis, including:

* Analysing the Data
* Visualizing feature distributions
* Analyzing correlations between features and survival
* Feature engineering

## Model Training and Prediction

The `Model.ipynb` notebook contains the model training and prediction, including:

* Data preprocessing and feature engineering
* Splitting data into training and validation sets
* Training a Random Forest Classifier model
